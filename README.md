# u2ai-decomposer

Multi-phase AI-agentic web-template (screenshot) image decomposer and restorer/extender.

- Named CLI as `ai-decompose`.
- Config in `~/.ai-decompose/config.json`.
- Node.js 26+, ESM, no SDK.

## Pipeline

Six stages run in sequence, each producing artifacts in `./decomposition/`:

│  0. extend       │  Grow reference frame if content is cut through real content.

│  1. decompose    │  Split reference into ordered screens with sub-references.

│  2. rectify      │  Un-rotate / recover projection, cut collages into screens.

└────────┬────────┘

│  3. reconstruct  │  Restore lost details via AI box-patch and verify.

└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  4. overlap      │  Remove overlapping elements from/by other screens (AI).
│  (new)           │  → ./decomposition/overlap/
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  5. resolve      │  Assemble final decomposition.json + layers (advanced).
│  (final)         │  → ./decomposition.json + layers/
└─────────────────┘
```

## Usage

```bash
ai-decompose -i screenshot.png
ai-decompose -i collage.png --stages decompose,rectify
ai-decompose -i original.png --advanced --out ./output
```

## Architecture

### Roles (src/roles/*.js)

| Role | Stage | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `extender` | extend | Decide if frame needs growing; write band instruction |
| `decomposer` | decompose | Name screens, crop/restore sub-references |
| `rectifier` | rectify | Place quad corners, call `correct_perspective` |
| `restorer` | reconstruct | Identify defects (leftover/missing/seam/artefact), write patch instructions |
| `overlap` | overlap | Compare screens, identify foreign elements in crops |
| `director` | resolve | Assemble final JSON, manage layers/advanced |

### Image Layer (src/image/*.js)

Sharp → Canvas → ImageMagick fallback chain:
- `raster.js`: crop, patch, decodeRgba, pad, compare
- `rectify.js`: perspective correction, residual skew measurement
- `magick.js`: ImageMagick wrapper
- `padding.js`: canvas expansion
- `canvas.js`: node-canvas abstraction

### Config

- File: `~/.ai-decompose/config.json`
- Env prefix: `AI_DECOMPOSE_`
- Substitutions: `{{env:NAME}}`
- Backends and imagesBackends pools

## Lineage

The phases were ported from the monolith `Universal-AI` (0.2.xx), where they lived in
`archive/reference-phases/` and failed inside the agent flow: an image editor has no stable contract
for "grow this frame", the role refused to name the corners of a skewed photo, and the seam of a
generative answer was never the source. Here they are the pipeline itself, each stage with its own
role, its own directory and its own tests.

The files that came from the monolith carry `@ai.hint legacy-0.2` in their header: the openai layer,
the image layer, the agent layer, the roles and the three stages that grew out of the archived
phases. The files written for this package do not.

The monolith reaches this package through one command: `ai decompose` delegates to `ai-decompose`.

```bash
npm i -g @u2ai/decomposer     # or: AI_DECOMPOSE_BIN=/path/to/ai-decompose.js
ai decompose --image collage.png
```

The monolith looks for the binary in `AI_DECOMPOSE_BIN`, in `submodules/u2ai-decomposer`, in
`node_modules/@u2ai/decomposer` and in `PATH`.
